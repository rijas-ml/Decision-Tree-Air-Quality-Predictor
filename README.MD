Decision Tree Air Quality Predictor

A machine learning project using DecisionTreeRegressor (scikit-learn) to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) from environmental features.

Features Used

Temperature (°C)
Humidity (%)
Wind Speed (km/h)
NO₂ concentration
PM2.5 concentration
(PM = Particulate Matter
2.5 = particles ≤ 2.5 micrometers in diameter.)

[These particles are so tiny they can bypass your nose and throat and go straight into your lungs and bloodstream]

Model

Algorithm: DecisionTreeRegressor
Depth: 4
Train-test split: 80/20

Results

The model achieved:
 Good accuracy due to clear relationships
 Feature importance showing which pollutants affect AQI most
